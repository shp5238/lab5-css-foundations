# LAB 5 Documentation

## Outstanding Issues

- CSS code and styling must be completed. DONE, but revise correctly within requirements. 
- Format this code properly. It needs to be indented properly and revised to be as short as possible with meaningful code. 
- use Flexbox to align inputs
- add button hover styling
- follow additional steps of lab instructions, review code, and submit.

## Resolved Issues

- Added a barebones html structure based on lecture walkthrough. Prioritized semantic html over presentational HTML.

## Notes (not true yet)
- Most issues have been resolved. The site is fully functional and styled across pages.
