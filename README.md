# LAB 5 Documentation

## Outstanding Issues

- [X] Define custom variables in css for values so that there are no "magic values" and things are clear.  
- [ ] Format this code properly. It needs to be indented properly and revised to be as short as possible with meaningful code. 
- [ ] use Flexbox to align inputs
- [ ] revise code to include css flexbox grid. 
- [X] ensure units are relative and appropriate. 
- [ ] follow additional steps of lab instructions, review code, and submit.

- The page does not render with localhost exactly the same way as it does with VSCode Live Server. 
    - Perhaps the issue comes from the custom elements that aren't being recognized in the localhost, but I find it weird that certain things do not render at all. 
    Here is a list of the discrepancies: 
        - Button hover color for both submit and forgot password do not show up. 
        - forgot password text color is default and not custom. Underline present. 
        - the forgot password is placed immediately next to the submit button (sign in). Justify-content property isn't rendering. 
        - the alignment of the input fields is off. Input boxes are indented right. 
        

## Resolved Issues

- Added a barebones html structure based on lecture walkthrough. Prioritized semantic html over presentational HTML.
- CSS code and styling is completed and revised within requirements.
- Implemented button hover styling for both sign in button and forgot password button. Also subtle hover transitions. 
- Applied form field styling and ensured matching typography throughout the page to required specifications.

## Notes (not true yet)
- Most issues have been resolved. The site is fully functional and styled across pages.
